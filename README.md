Hey, and thanks for checking out NovLib.

NovLib is my contribution to Javid @OneLoneCoder's olcCodeJam2019. A big shout out Javid for having a Jam open to beginners that allowed me to get this contribution done.

A little bit about using NovLib:

NovLib is a silly little app where you can play mad libs with some classic literature. We're talking Alice in Wonderland and Moby Dick and the like. You can really destroy some solidly written text with this app, and I hope you enjoy it. 

I wish I could've made the GUI a bit more intuitive to read but this is how you go about successfully using NovLib. First pick a text from the pull down/combo box (as I've learned they're called). Then press the "Import Text" button to load the text into the textbox on the right. From there, enter a word in the text under "Replace" and the word you want to replace it with under "With", then press NovLib which will swap the original word for you word choice throughout the entire text. Lastly, if you just want to view the sentences in text that you changed you can press the "View Lib'd Sentences Only" radio button.(You can toggle back and forth between sentences and full text using the "View Entire Text". Finally, you can clear all the changes you made to the text with "Clear Libs". 

Thanks for checking out NovLibs and I hope you enjoy!
